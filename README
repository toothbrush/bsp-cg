QUESTIONS

* Distribution v?
* Distribution x? Same as v.
* Distribution r? Same as v.
* Distribution p? Same as v. 
* Distribution w? Same as v.
* motivate above choices
* Time complexity

* implement bspcg using bspmv and bspip

* write test matrix generator. assertions on this matrix
* use Mondriaan to distribute this matrix (and vectors??)

* experiment and explain. 
* try different n and p and nonzero densities
* runtime of bspcg scale with p?
* what is bottleneck?
* is nItersNeeded dependent on P and distribution?
